# WeatherWise 🌤️

WeatherWise is a React-based weather forecast application that allows users to search for cities and view real-time weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and 7-day forecasts using a public Weather API.

The goal of this project was to build a responsive frontend application that consumes an external API, manages state effectively, and provides a clean and intuitive user experience.
